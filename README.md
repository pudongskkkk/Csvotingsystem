# E-Mobile Voting System for the College of Computer Studies of PhilCST

## Project Overview

This project proposes the development of an E-Mobile Voting System specifically designed for the College of Computer Studies (CCS) at the Philippine College of Science and Technology (PhilCST)[cite: 1, 17]. The primary goal is to optimize and improve the overall efficiency of the voting process for student elections[cite: 27]. This system aims to address current challenges such as long lines, slow vote counting, and low participation, ultimately making student elections more modern, fair, and accessible[cite: 20, 21].

## Features

The E-Mobile Voting System will offer a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for student elections[cite: 11, 19]. Key features include:

* **Secure Login:** Ensures only eligible students can access the system[cite: 19].
* **Real-time Vote Counting:** Provides immediate updates on election results[cite: 19].
* **Easy-to-Use Design:** Prioritizes a user-friendly interface for convenient voting[cite: 19, 42].
* **Automated Processes:** Automates key election processes such as voting, vote counting, and result generation[cite: 34].
* **Administrative Functions:** Allows administrators to manage candidates and voter accounts[cite: 34].
* **Multi-platform Access:** Students can vote using web or Android platforms[cite: 35].
* **LAN-based Connectivity:** Operates over a Local Area Network (LAN) within the school premises[cite: 36, 38].
* **Automatic Vote Syncing:** Ensures votes are synced when reconnected to the network[cite: 36].

## Scope and Delimitations

### Scope

* The system is specifically designed to improve the voting process within the College of Computer Studies at PhilCST[cite: 33].
* It automates key processes including voting, vote counting, and result generation[cite: 34].
* Enables administrative functions such as adding candidates and managing voter accounts[cite: 34].
* Allows eligible students from the College of Computer Studies to vote using web or Android platforms[cite: 35].
* Operates over a Local Area Network (LAN) within the school premises, with automatic vote syncing when reconnected[cite: 36].

### Delimitations

* Voting is restricted to students enrolled in the College of Computer Studies only[cite: 37].
* The system does not support iOS devices[cite: 37].
* Accessible only within the PhilCST campus through LAN-based connectivity[cite: 38].
* Not intended for use in elections outside the College of Computer Studies[cite: 38].

## Research Methodology

### Research Design

The research design follows a quantitative approach, collecting and analyzing data through surveys and questionnaires to understand current voting issues and assess the benefits of the proposed system[cite: 39].

### System Development Method

The system development method is descriptive developmental, aimed at identifying problems with the existing system and determining the essential features for the new one[cite: 40]. The development process follows a modified waterfall model, using a flexible approach to design, build, and test the system while incorporating feedback for continuous improvement[cite: 41].

### Instrumentation/Sources of Data

* **Survey Questionnaires:** Two sets of surveys will be used[cite: 2].
    * **First Set (Students & Admin):** Questions about current voting methods, challenges, system needs, and suggested features[cite: 2].
    * **Second Set (IT Experts & Admin):** Focus on system testing, including user interface, functionality, and improvements[cite: 2].
* **Secondary Data Sources:**
    * **Books:** For key concepts in system development[cite: 3].
    * **Unpublished Theses:** For additional information from previous research[cite: 3].
    * **Internet Research:** For recent studies and technical information on voting systems[cite: 4].

### Data Analysis / Treatment of Data

Various methods will be used to analyze the data gathered from the CCS department at PhilCST[cite: 5, 6].

* **Slovin's Formula:** Will be applied to calculate the number of respondents needed for a representative sample[cite: 7].
* **Frequency Distribution and Percentages:** Will be used to identify trends and common responses[cite: 8].
* **Ranking:** Responses will be ranked from highest to lowest to organize the data effectively[cite: 9].
* **Five-Point Likert Scale:** Will be employed to measure users' opinions about the system, ranging from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree[cite: 10].
* **Weighted Average:** Will be used to calculate the average score of responses, providing a comprehensive analysis of the data[cite: 11].

## Ethical Considerations

* **Purpose:** To develop a secure and efficient voting system for PhilCST students[cite: 12].
* **Privacy:** Students' information will remain confidential and will not be shared in the results[cite: 13].
* **Objectives:** Improve voting efficiency and security, ensure accurate data collection, and recognize important studies[cite: 13].
* **Ethics:** Permission will be obtained from students to participate, and data use and access will be clearly explained[cite: 14].

## Getting Started

Further details on installation, usage, and contribution will be provided as the project progresses.
